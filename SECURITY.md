# Security Policy

To report a security vulnerability in GitHub, please report it through the coordinated disclosure process or use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

To report a security vulnerability, or a simple bug, in my repositories, we appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. 
Any concerns and advice provided by the vulnerability reporters will be taken into careful consideration, and are welcome as they provide more efficiency, efficacy and effectiveness in the fixing process.
